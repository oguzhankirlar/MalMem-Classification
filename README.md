This study aims to classify malware using machine learning methods on the [CIC-MamMem-2022 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/malmem-2022.html) . 
For the challenging problem of sixteen-class classification on this dataset, the best-known F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy values in the literature are 69.46%, 70.94%, 69.48%, and 69.48%, respectively. 
In this study, a particular focus was placed on the sixteen-class classification problem, and better results than the best-known results in the literature were achieved. 
As a result of the experimental studies, the F1 score, precision, recall, and accuracy values obtained with XGBoost were 75.53%, 75.43%, 75.65%, and 75.53%, respectively.
